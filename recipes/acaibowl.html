    <p>Description: This Homemade Acai Bowl recipe uses just 3 simple vegan ingredients for the most delicious DIY açai smoothie bowl ever! Using a high-powered blender, it’s ready within 5 minutes. Customize with your favorite toppings, like fresh berries, coconut flakes, and granola. Let’s make it!</p>

    <p>Ingredients</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Frozen Acai Berry Blend </li>
        <li>Frozen Banana</li>
        <li>Non-dairy Yogurt or Milk</li>
        <li>Fresh berries, granola, peanut butter (any toppings of your choice)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Steps</p>
    <ol>
        <li>In a high-powered blender, combine the acai berry packet, frozen banana, and ¼ cup dairy-free milk of choice.</li>
        <li>Blend on low, using the tamper to push down the ingredients, until your acai mixture is completely smooth. You may need to add more dairy-free milk until your smoothie blends smoothly. Try not to add more than necessary, or your bowl won’t be as thick and creamy. </li>
        <li>If your blender doesn’t have a tamper to press down the ingredients as they blend, you’ll need to stop frequently to scrape down the sides and push the unblinded ingredients down to the blades.</li>
        <li>Pour into a bowl and top with your favorite toppings. Enjoy immediately!</li>
    </ol>
